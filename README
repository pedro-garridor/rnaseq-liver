 # Additional data repository

 - `translation` folder: contains in-house protocol for translation using canonical M codon, along with its results.
 - `counts_matrix.tsv.tpm.tsv`: tab-separated table containing normalized expression values (TPM) for each transcript across samples, as provided by flair-quantify module. Provided that FLAIR is executed before SQANTI, some transcripts may be reported in this table, but not on ulterior steps, as they have been filtered out by the latter. Furthermore, certain transcripts passing SQANTI-filter module but showing low expression levels may not be reported by the quantification module due to technical reasons (see https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/flair/issues/77).
 - `flair.collapse.isoforms_classification.filtered_lite_classification.txt`: tab-separated table resulting from SQANTI-filter module. For further details on its contents, see [DOI 10.1101/gr.222976.117](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.222976.117) and https://github.com/ConesaLab/SQANTI3.
